#*Advent of Code 2020 Solutions!*

##Hello!
###Welcome to my super awesome totally "efficient" Advent of Code solutions! I am posting this publicly for fun! Critique is always welcome, but this will be an expanding project as well as I complete more and more of the challenges.

*My intention?
- Just to have fun and have something to look back at to know how far I've come, assuming github sticks around.

*My goal?
- To improve these solutions over time as well as improve how I get the problem from the website to make solving these challenges much more automated for years to come.

*Your role?
- Your role of course is to be you, improving my problem solving can be a hard process sometimes when you don't know where to start, so any input or feedback you have is very much appreciated and welcomed. Just to reiterate if I haven't already, thank you so very much if your here :) !
