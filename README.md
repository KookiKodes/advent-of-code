# _Advent of Code 2020 Solutions!_

### Welcome to my super awesome totally "efficient" Advent of Code solutions! I am posting this publicly for fun! Critique is always welcome, but this will be an expanding project as well as I complete more and more of the challenges.

# Important Note!: This project uses Deno, so make sure you visit https://deno.land and install the latest version of Deno if you don't already have it!

- My intention?
  -> Just to have fun and have something to look back at to know how far I've come, assuming github sticks around.

- My goal?
  -> To improve these solutions over time as well as improve how I get the problem from the website to make solving these challenges much more automated for years to come. I also just wanted to play around with Deno! Which I am finding that I very much love :)!

- Your role?
  -> Your role of course is to be you, improving my problem solving can be a hard process sometimes when you don't know where to start, so any input or feedback you have is very much appreciated and welcomed. Just to reiterate if I haven't already, thank you so very much if your here :) !

# How to use:

### 1. Create a .env file with a COOKIE value set to your advent of code's cookie;

## 2. To fetch the input data from advent type `deno run -A --unstable task.ts fetch`

## 3. To generate an output file with the answers to the problem type `deno run -A --unstable task.ts output`
